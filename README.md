The digital extension of the artistic project “Les quais”, for the Jean Jaurès junior high school in [La Ciotat](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/La_Ciotat).


Building
--------

This site is built with the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) engine.

Jekyll ≥ v2.1 is needed to build the site. It is not officially out at the time of writing, which means you need to build it from `master`.

Once it's installed, simply run:

```
jekyll build
```

The resulting website is in `_site`. Just publish that to the target server and serve static files.


Deploying
---------

Deployment is made through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), on repo LesQuais/lesquais.github.io.
